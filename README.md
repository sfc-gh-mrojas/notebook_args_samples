# Snowflake Notebooks: Parameter-Passing and Centralized Task Execution

This repository provides an example of how to streamline data engineering workflows in Snowflake by leveraging parameterized notebooks and centralized task execution. It is designed to simplify complex workflows, reduce redundancy, and enhance flexibility by using a single notebook to execute multiple data flows depending on parameter inputs from various tasks.

## Features

- **Parameter Passing in Notebooks**: Demonstrates how to pass parameters to Snowflake notebooks by positition.
- **Centralized Notebook Execution**: Shows how to use one or a few parameterized notebooks to run different data flows, eliminating the need to create a task per notebook.
- **Multiple Task Configurations**: Defines two tasks with different parameter configurations, each executing the same notebook, to illustrate flexible data engineering setups.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A Snowflake account with access to Snowsight Notebooks.
- Familiarity with Snowflake tasks and Snowpark.

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project directory.
2. **Review the parameterized notebook** in `notebooks/parameterized_notebook.sql` to understand how parameters are referenced and used.
3. **Create notebook** in Snowflake with the name `notebook_with_parameters` and import the content from the `notebooks/notebook_with_parameters/notebook_app.ipynb` file.


### Example Parameter Configuration

The notebook accepts the following parameters (which are used in ordinal position):
- `name`
- `lastname`

The notebook leverages the `sys.argv` to read arguments.

In this case we just insert the name and lastname into a table

You can test this notebook by running the following commands in Snowflake:

```sql
EXECUTE NOTEBOOK NOTEBOOK_WITH_PARAMETERS('Mickey Mouse'); 
```

### Centralized Control Flow.

Based on the arguments you can control the flow of the notebook. In this notebook we did just a very basic branching based on the `args[0]` parameter.

```python
args = sys.argv
if args[0] == "John":
    session.sql("""
    INSERT INTO NOTEBOOK_ARGUMENTS_SAMPLE VALUES ('{}','The notebook was called with John','Done')
    """).show()
```

You can even do other `EXECUTE NOTEBOOK` calls based on the arguments.

### Multiple Task Configurations

1. **Define Task 1 and Task 2** by executing `tasks/task1_definition.sql` and `tasks/task2_definition.sql` in Snowflake.
2. Both tasks will reference the same notebook with different parameter configurations, allowing you to observe how a centralized notebook can accommodate varied data flows.
